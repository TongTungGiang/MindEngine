\subsection*{Classes}
\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
\item 
struct \hyperlink{structRules_1_1DataGroupMatch}{Data\+Group\+Match}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em Matches a group of data in the database. This is done by building a match data structure that mirrors the data structure that is being searched for in the database. \end{DoxyCompactList}\item 
struct \hyperlink{structRules_1_1DataNodeMatch}{Data\+Node\+Match}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em A struct derived from \hyperlink{structRules_1_1Match}{Match}, it is responsible for matching a single Data\+Node in the database. \end{DoxyCompactList}\item 
struct \hyperlink{structRules_1_1Match}{Match}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em Provides the mechanism to match the data item from the rule with any item inside the database. \end{DoxyCompactList}\item 
class \hyperlink{classRules_1_1Rule}{Rule}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em Represent a rule in a Rule-\/based system. A rule has two components\+: an if clause is going to be used to match against the database and a function to perform any action required. \end{DoxyCompactList}\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
